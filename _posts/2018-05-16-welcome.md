Hello there!

This page is about my programming experiments.

I usually work with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), but I'm interested in some other languages like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org), [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

I love learning new stuff, mostly through small projects and demos which will be published to my [github](https://github.com/kiskoza).
